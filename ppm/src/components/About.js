    <h2>How it All Began</h2>
<span className=" origin-text">
<p>Postpartum Momma was founded by Anaidys Jimenez as a forum to provided resources during the postpartum period of motherhood. In her first few months postpartum, Anaidys realized that not only was being a new mom difficult; it was isolating. She struggled with anxious and depressive thoughts that kept her from being fully present for herself and her baby. By the end of the day she was unbathed, with streaks of spit up on her robe, and tears streaming down her cheeks as she held her sleeping baby. In the middle of a 3am nursing session, when it felt like everyone but her was sound asleep, she wondered if she was really the only one feeling this way. Postpartum Momma is here to empower your motherhood journey and remind you that you are not alone in this! </p>

        <p> In November of 2023, I became a mother to a beautiful baby boy named Luca Elias. I'm on an exclusively breastfeeding journey and hoping to stay the course for as long as my body allows. I am currently on maternity leave, but will soon be returning to my job as a Lead Geometry Teacher at my alma mater high school. </p>

    <p> In December of 2022, I became a mom to the sweetest baby girl, Jael Elise. I breastfed until about 7 months, when I returned to work part - time. When not spending time running after my toddler, I am completing my master/'s in ABA, and working at a behavioral clinic. I am grateful for the support of my partner and family members to be able to continue my studies while juggling motherhood and my career. </p>

    <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
  
<span className="beliefs-row">
    <span className="beliefs-text">
       
        <h3>You are a great mother.</h3>
        <p>Motherhood looks different for different women. Although our journeys may be different we are all trying to do what is best for our child. No one can tell you how to best parent your child. Postpartum Momma is here as a resource to provide insight and allow you to learn different skills. Feel free to pick and choose as you build your motherhood tool belt. </p>

    <span className="beliefs-text">
        
        <h3>Fed is best.</h3>
        <p>Postpartum Momma does not endorse one method of feeding as the best method. As previously mentioned, each motherhood journey is unique and we intend to encourage and support all mothers through their feeding journeys. We provide various resources for breastfeeding (nursing and pumping) and formula-feeding mothers. Please choose the method that is most conducive to your mental health, lifestyle, and child's needs.</p>

        <h3>You cannot pour from an empty cup.</h3>
        <p>As they say, the days are long and the years are short. As mothers, we can often get so caught up in being everything at all times for our babies that we forget to do things for ourselves. This is understandable; you have a tiny human that depends on you for their livelihood and you don't want to miss a single moment! Just remember, in order to pour yourself into your child you're going to need to refuel spiritually, physically, and mentally.</p>
