      "Let me just start off by saying that this is not the kind of blog post that is going to try and pressure you to 'snapback' to your pre-pregnancy body as quickly as possible. I don't have any tips, tricks, tummy creams, or even an exercise regiment for you. I just wanted to let you know that it's okay to give yourself and your body grace as you navigate healing the dinner plate sized wound left behind in your uterus by baby and the placenta. Many mommas are unaware that as this wound attempts to heal over the course of 6 months (minimum) your core muscles and pelvic floor are also in dire need of healing. You just grew an entire human being and they needed some space to grow. Where there wasn't space they created space by pushing your ab muscles out of the way. This caused you to have diastasis recti. Even after baby is no longer in your womb, your muscles are going to need some gentle nudging to getting back to where they once were. Many women that complain of back pains, pelvic pains, c-section scar area pains are going through this because they haven't healed their diastasis. Here is an infographic from the Mutu System, who specialize in helping women heal their bodies. I hope that as we learn more about our bodies we are able to give it the TLC it deserves.",

Here are some of our favorite toy subscription boxes. These companies do the research so that you do not have to! The Lovevery play kits are montessori inspired toy subscription boxes. Each box is backed by thorough research to ensure that your baby is reaching their developmental milestones through play. Luca and I have enjoyed playing with our bi-montly subscription toys they come equipt with a play guide to give you ideas for how to best introduce each toy to your baby. I can say for a fact that these toys have helped my little one reached key milestones like discovering his feet with the jingle socks, prolonging his tummy time with the mirror, or improving his fine motor skills with the tissue box.",
